## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light grey-blue (#A7C4C4) to give a technological but calm, easy-to-work-in feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2F4F3), with a very light grey-blue hue, for a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: Deep teal (#2A7A74), to highlight interactive elements without causing too much distraction from the main grey/white interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, known for its clear, readable style and modern appearance.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying any inline code within prompts or diagram explanations.
- Use flat, minimalist icons that clearly represent different architectural components. Maintain consistency with color palette.
- Clean, intuitive layout with canvas dominating the workspace. Arrange controls and prompts in side panels to avoid clutter.
- Subtle transitions and animations for drag-and-drop actions and diagram updates.
