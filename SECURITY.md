# Security Policy

The security of ArchiSketch is a top priority. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a secure platform.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We encourage you to report vulnerabilities privately to give us time to address them before they are publicly disclosed.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to:

`security@example.com` (replace with a real email address for a live project)

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.
- The component or part of the application where the vulnerability was found.
- Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos that can help us understand the issue.
- Your name or alias for recognition in our security acknowledgments, if you wish.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We will work to validate the vulnerability and will keep you informed of our progress.
- We will take appropriate action to address the vulnerability.
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability has been resolved, if you wish.

Thank you for helping keep ArchiSketch secure.
